# Class-Routine-in-C-with-GUI
In this repository I made a class routine project for my class schedule of Sonargaon University. 
That was my first project in C Programming Language.
Classroutine is fully coded in C programming language with Exceptional Graphical User Interface. 
Classroutine has a extra library "graphics.h". 
Classroutine is fully coded in C programming language but when I create Classroom Project in IDE I select project as C++(cpp) for GUI
